- Estimates “Pay to Target” amounts for each card.

- Optional local saving (everything stays on your device).

1. Enter your credit cards — just names, limits, and balances.  
2. Click **Calculate** to see utilization and payment suggestions.  
3. Optionally enter how much you can pay now to see payoff guidance.

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Enter plain numbers only (no dollar signs or commas).  
> Example: type `1000`, not `1,000`.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

This app is designed to be lightweight and safe to use:

- Everything runs entirely in your browser.  
- No accounts, logins, or data uploads.  
- If you enable **“Save my data on this device”**, information is stored only in your browser’s local storage.  
- Turning off that option clears it immediately.

> Avoid entering sensitive info like full card numbers, bank logins, or SSNs.  
> Using generic names like “Card 1” or “Blue Card” is perfectly fine.
