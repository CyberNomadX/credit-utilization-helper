## 🕵️ Privacy & Data Storage

This app is designed to protect your privacy:

- Everything runs entirely in your browser.  
- By default, no data is saved anywhere.  
- If you enable **“Save my data on this device”**, information is stored only in your browser’s `localStorage`.  
- Nothing is uploaded, tracked, or shared.

> 💬 Avoid entering sensitive info like full card numbers, bank logins, or SSNs.  
> Generic names like “Card 1” or “Blue Card” are fine.
